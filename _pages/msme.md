They have provided various Entrepreneurship and Skill development programs few of which were taken up by the college. This has assisted all the budding entrepreneurs in and off the campus. This support has also helped in developing the socio-economic status of Nation.

        <p>Blind Spots are the areas around the vehicle that cannot be directly observed by the driver even though rear view and side mirrors are available and exactly placed. Sphasht, the proposed gadget augments a regular steering wheel as a smart steering wheel that would indicate the proximity of other adjacent vehicles in “no zones”  ( for 18 wheeler Trucks) and “blind spots” (for regular passenger four wheelers). </p>
        <p>The whole system is designed to retrofit with easy assembly that would reduce the cost and improve the customer base, while providing a safety system which is virtually useful to everyone especially elderly and differently abled. When a vehicle enters the blind spot, the visual indicator present within the product fit to the steering wheel will light up depending upon the proximity. Once the proximity reaches a set threshold limit, the audio indicator.</p>

        <p><b><!--<a href="https://megford.github.io/teach-gnome-newcomer/" target="_blank">-->Project: The Smart Pill Dispenser<!--</a>--></b></p>

        <p>Population aging is a global issue. The decline in physical function with aging leads to an increase in incidences of various chronic diseases in elderly individuals; most patients with chronic diseases must take medication for a prolonged period of time in order to stabilize their condition and have to take medicines at appropriate time. And if there are more than one elderly individual present in a house there will be a confusion between the tablets they take. </p>
        <p>
       The smart pill dispenser will provide a solution for two of the major problems:<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         1. Reminding the individual about the time to take the medication.<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         2.	The pill dispenser dispenses the right medicine for the right person based on the fingerprint.<br>
