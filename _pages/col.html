    Competitions are the best thing ever happened to mankind. They force the best out of us. They help in bringing the best in the products. They teach to accept failure and strive harder. A healthy competition always helps in keeping you active and dynamic.

        </p>

        <p>
          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

        <p>Blind Spots are the areas around the vehicle that cannot be directly observed by the driver even though rear view and side mirrors are available and exactly placed. Sphasht, the proposed gadget augments a regular steering wheel as a smart steering wheel that would indicate the proximity of other adjacent vehicles in “no zones”  ( for 18 wheeler Trucks) and “blind spots” (for regular passenger four wheelers). </p>
        <p>The whole system is designed to retrofit with easy assembly that would reduce the cost and improve the customer base, while providing a safety system which is virtually useful to everyone especially elderly and differently abled. When a vehicle enters the blind spot, the visual indicator present within the product fit to the steering wheel will light up depending upon the proximity. Once the proximity reaches a set threshold limit, the audio indicator.</p>

        <p><b><!--<a href="https://megford.github.io/teach-gnome-newcomer/" target="_blank">-->Project: The Smart Pill Dispenser<!--</a>--></b></p>

        <p>Population aging is a global issue. The decline in physical function with aging leads to an increase in incidences of various chronic diseases in elderly individuals; most patients with chronic diseases must take medication for a prolonged period of time in order to stabilize their condition and have to take medicines at appropriate time. And if there are more than one elderly individual present in a house there will be a confusion between the tablets they take. </p>
        <p>
       The smart pill dispenser will provide a solution for two of the major problems:<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         1. Reminding the individual about the time to take the medication.<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         2.	The pill dispenser dispenses the right medicine for the right person based on the fingerprint.<br>

        <p>The proposed idea is a real time inventory monitoring and logistics system that  notifies the quantities of various food supplies and grocery items through an IoT based sensor hardware that is augmented by a mobile application. The proposed smart containers application alerts when the quantity fall short . The app enables the user to optimise purchases based on the current requirement of products effectively without human intervention.</p>

    Motivation is a critical aspect in life which leads to better performance. There are several reasons why motivation is important. Mainly because it allows management to meet the ones goals. If you want to achieve greatness, you need to stop asking for permission. This is why motivation is important in life because it stops asking questions and aligns you to work towards your goals. Being a role model is also a key motivator that influences people in reaching their goals. A leader should set a good example to ensure his people to grow and achieve their goals effectively. Having all such thoughts in mind, the Students Innovation team has organised talks by leaders.

        <p>Another such seminar was by Eric MacDonald, Professor and Friedman Chair at the Youngstown state university. He is a PhD holder and works with the Electrical and computer engineering branch of the university. He also deals with the manufacturing program that the university takes up. With over 6 patents, 35 journals, the conference at the institute was just another talk of the 60 such conferences he was invited to and he has taken up.
