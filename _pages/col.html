      The abbreviated form of MSME,<b> Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises </b>, it has been a supporter of all the vibrant innovations that happen at the graduate and post-graduate levels. They have provided various Entrepreneurship and Skill development programs few of which were taken up by the college. This has assisted all the budding entrepreneurs in and off the campus. This support has also helped in developing the socio-economic status of Nation.At MSME-THON, about 200+ student innovators from 20 reputed engineering colleges from Hyderabad are matched up into small groups and given space and resources to generate new ideas, software, hardware or product plans over the course of 1-2 days of hacking.

      MSMEs that provided the problem statement in hackathon are opening themselves to outside innovation by inviting students to work on solving a problem or generate ideas on behalf of their organization. 
    </P>
  <p> 
  While traditional methods for managing innovation focus on improving the mean, competitions maximize the variance. Although on average normal participants tend to perform worse than the industry experts, competitors introduce much more variance, creating “outside the box” solutions that outperform the average industry
  <br>
    Attendees receive experience from attending the hackathon and the company is able to take ideas and projects generated from the hackathon to use for future projects and ventures. This method of generating innovation in a corporation by reaching outside to the public through open-source hacking can be seen as a form of corporate entrepreneurship through “emergence of new ideas from various levels in the organization” taken even one-step farther by reaching outside the organization.

        <p>Blind Spots are the areas around the vehicle that cannot be directly observed by the driver even though rear view and side mirrors are available and exactly placed. Sphasht, the proposed gadget augments a regular steering wheel as a smart steering wheel that would indicate the proximity of other adjacent vehicles in “no zones”  ( for 18 wheeler Trucks) and “blind spots” (for regular passenger four wheelers). </p>
        <p>The whole system is designed to retrofit with easy assembly that would reduce the cost and improve the customer base, while providing a safety system which is virtually useful to everyone especially elderly and differently abled. When a vehicle enters the blind spot, the visual indicator present within the product fit to the steering wheel will light up depending upon the proximity. Once the proximity reaches a set threshold limit, the audio indicator.</p>

        <p>Population aging is a global issue. The decline in physical function with aging leads to an increase in incidences of various chronic diseases in elderly individuals; most patients with chronic diseases must take medication for a prolonged period of time in order to stabilize their condition and have to take medicines at appropriate time. And if there are more than one elderly individual present in a house there will be a confusion between the tablets they take. </p>
        <p>
       The smart pill dispenser will provide a solution for two of the major problems:<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         1. Reminding the individual about the time to take the medication.<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         2.	The pill dispenser dispenses the right medicine for the right person based on the fingerprint.<br>

        <p>The proposed idea is a real time inventory monitoring and logistics system that  notifies the quantities of various food supplies and grocery items through an IoT based sensor hardware that is augmented by a mobile application. The proposed smart containers application alerts when the quantity fall short . The app enables the user to optimise purchases based on the current requirement of products effectively without human intervention.</p>

     Since citizens of India are its most valuable resource, our billion-strong nation needs the nurture and care in the form of basic education to achieve a better quality of life. This warrants an all-round development of our citizens, which can be achieved by building strong foundations in education. In pursuance of this mission, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) was created on September 26, 1985, through the 174th amendment to the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961.

        <p>Another such seminar was by Eric MacDonald, Professor and Friedman Chair at the Youngstown state university. He is a PhD holder and works with the Electrical and computer engineering branch of the university. He also deals with the manufacturing program that the university takes up. With over 6 patents, 35 journals, the conference at the institute was just another talk of the 60 such conferences he was invited to and he has taken up. His talk has given confidence and motivation to many students who were otherwise worried.</p>
