        <p>Blind Spots are the areas around the vehicle that cannot be directly observed by the driver even though rear view and side mirrors are available and exactly placed. Sphasht, the proposed gadget augments a regular steering wheel as a smart steering wheel that would indicate the proximity of other adjacent vehicles in “no zones”  ( for 18 wheeler Trucks) and “blind spots” (for regular passenger four wheelers). </p>
        <p>The whole system is designed to retrofit with easy assembly that would reduce the cost and improve the customer base, while providing a safety system which is virtually useful to everyone especially elderly and differently abled. When a vehicle enters the blind spot, the visual indicator present within the product fit to the steering wheel will light up depending upon the proximity. Once the proximity reaches a set threshold limit, the audio indicator.</p>

        <p>The proposed idea is a real time inventory monitoring and logistics system that  notifies the quantities of various food supplies and grocery items through an IoT based sensor hardware that is augmented by a mobile application. The proposed smart containers application alerts when the quantity fall short . The app enables the user to optimise purchases based on the current requirement of products effectively without human intervention.</p>
